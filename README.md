**Introduction**

My logo is very simple, I think it is the simplest form of personal logo. Because it is just my initials – SKJ – (Sebastian Kazimierz Juszkiewicz, First Name Second Name and Surname). But even when it is not so creative and something unusual it is effective and very official because I can use it everywhere where I want to. But starting from the beginning now, when I was in college my tutors asked me if I can put my full name in all documents, assignments and e-mails. Well my full name is not counting to the short ones and to be honest I was lazy to type my full name all the time so I asked them if I can short it and just use my initials in naming documents and then in thought about SKJ. They approve and then I was using these 3 letters as my signature on documents and assignments. But somehow, I have never thought about using it as my personal and professional logo because I thought it is too simple and basic. 

**Logo**

But when my Digital Creativity course started my first task was design your logo and then I start thinking about why not to use my initials as my logo. And then I start doing my research about logos to get inspiration and draw something. I was browsing threw Instagram, google and Facebook to find something and then I remembered about Celtic/Scandinavian runes which I have never seen in any type of logo.  You can find a rune that looks like our “S” but very angular but then I couldn’t find something that will looks like a “K” and “J” so I design and to be honest at the beginning I liked it. But then when I sketch it, I sketched it few times and then I realize its not that I could not use it as my logo, and I have to find a different design. I was sure then I want to use my initials, but I was needed something more official, something that I can use on a website or even business card. After spending some time trying to get some ideas what I can do with it. I thought why not to just make it in an office and minimalistic style. I was experimenting with different fonts, styles and then I found two fonts that I want to use. One of it is Garamond Classico SC which I used in my Business Card design and for me it looks smooth and very official. Second font which is my main font that I used in my main logo design is “Josefin Sans” I choose this font because in meanwhile I got an idea adding two dots inside of the “S” letter. Why? Because this font has symmetric “S” which is perfect for ying-yang reference. As a reference for trying to maintain a balance in design as ying-yang is contrast between one and two.  I think this idea gives something extra to my logo and makes it something more than just my 3 initials. When I finally found fonts that I want to use and implement ying-yang reference I started looking for other inspiration and ideas but as you can see in my sketches that I tried to sketch few different ideas.
