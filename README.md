**Introduction**

My logo is very simple, I think it is the simplest form of personal logo. Because it is just my initials – SKJ – (Sebastian Kazimierz Juszkiewicz, First Name Second Name and Surname). But even when it is not so creative and something unusual it is effective and very official because I can use it everywhere where I want to. But starting from the beginning now, when I was in college my tutors asked me if I can put my full name in all documents, assignments and e-mails. Well my full name is not counting to the short ones and to be honest I was lazy to type my full name all the time so I asked them if I can short it and just use my initials in naming documents and then in thought about SKJ. They approve and then I was using these 3 letters as my signature on documents and assignments. But somehow, I have never thought about using it as my personal and professional logo because I thought it is too simple and basic. 

**Logo**

But when my Digital Creativity course started my first task was design your logo and then I start thinking about why not to use my initials as my logo. And then I start doing my research about logos to get inspiration and draw something. I was lurking threw Instagram, google and Facebook to find something and then I remembered about Celtic/Scandinavian runes which I have never seen in any type of logo.  You can find a rune that looks like our “S” but very angular but then I couldn’t find something that will looks like a “K” and “J” so I design and to be honest at the beginning I liked it. But then when I sketch it, I sketched it few times and then I realize its not that I could not use it as my logo, and I have to find a different design. I was sure then I want to use my initials, but I was needed something more official, something that I can use on a website or even business card. After spending some time trying to get some ideas what I can do with it. I thought why not to just make it in an office and minimalistic style. I was experimenting with different fonts, styles and then I found two fonts that I want to use. One of it is Garamond Classico SC which I used in my Business Card design and for me it looks smooth and very official. Second font which is my main font that I used in my main logo design is “Josefin Sans” I choose this font because in meanwhile I got an idea adding two dots inside of the “S” letter. Why? Because this font has symmetric “S” which is perfect for ying-yang reference. As a reference for trying to maintain a balance in design as ying-yang is contrast between one and two.  I think this idea gives something extra to my logo and makes it something more than just my 3 initials. When I finally found fonts that I want to use and implement ying-yang reference I started looking for other inspiration and ideas but as you can see in my sketches that I tried to sketch few different ideas. As you can see, I have tried to sketch it in a different style but almost none of them I used in my final logo idea.

**Business Card**
My second task that I wanted to achieve was design a business card, because my final logo is very simple. I found a lot of different styles, ideas and designs there was a lot of different and creative inspirations. But I wanted to design a plain, clear and simple business card and my inspiration was a business card from “American Psycho” movie. Exactly from the scene where main character admires each other business card. I choose it because in my opinion and aesthetic taste it perfectly fits with my logo.

As you can see it is just a black text on a white canvas, but font, font make whole work here. Font and correct position of content makes this business card looks aesthetic and clean without any colours or shapes.


**Inspiration and ideas** 

When I was browsing the web, I found many great and creative logos with so many different styles and ideas. I was even checking trending logos in the current year and when I am looking on my sketches then I can see that I was doing them in a “Letter Illusions” style where my letter were made in a different and various way. As you can see there this sketch might looks like it came from an arcade game or some kind of poor design process. Of course, there is a lot of bad designs which just looks bad or be poorly sketched it forced me to continue looking for inspiration and finding a new idea. 
One of my idea was using a Scandinavian rune as an inspiration for my logo and I tried to design it and as you can see there, I tried to sketch it few times. But it was this same problem as with idea before it looked poor and just boring.
